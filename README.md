# About
This project presents an approach for oil spill detection using CNNs to classify images into one of two categories: those containing oil spills and those that do not. By training our CNN on the oil spill dataset, we aim to enhance detection performance by generating a confusion matrix to assess how well the model differentiates between oil spills and non-oil spills.



# Dataset
The Oil Spill Dataset was obtained from Kaggle's repository. It is a meticulously balanced dataset of 4000 RGB images portraying scenes from seas and oceans. Each image varies in size and resolution, capturing a mix of clean environments and instances of oil spills.
